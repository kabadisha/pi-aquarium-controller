# pi-aquarium-controller
A raspberry pi powered aquarium controller. Monitors temperature and controls lights, air and CO2.

This replaces the original Arduino powered aquarium controller and has the following advantages:

- Is network connected:
  - can be managed remotely.
  - can send alerts.
  - can use NTP for accurate time-keeping.
- Multiple on/off times for air, CO2 and lights
- Other stuff as I think of it...
